Free V-AMP
----------

  Free V-AMP is a program for controlling the Behringer V-AMP 2 modelling
amplifier.  It is intended to be a free replacement for Behringer's
"V-AMP Design" program.

  Free V-AMP is written for POSIX-compatible operating systems, such as
GNU/Linux.  It requires GTK+ version 2.0 or later; see:

    http://www.gtk.org/

for information.

  See the file INSTALL for configuration and installation
instructions.

  Please send bug reports to Gary Wong <gtw@gnu.org>.
